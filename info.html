          <p>What is nav international? Nav intenational is a website that shows a bunch of places you could vsit that i think are awsome. Yes a lot of places you can vsit in the USA but there a few that are sprinkeled in there that are in other places.
            places: 
            1. helena, montana, why i like this place is because one, its my home capital, and two, because there a lot of stuff to do!
            2. tokyo, japan, it' tokyo who dosen't want to go to tokyo!
            3. madrid, spain, the only reason i did this one is because i've always been a big fan of spain
            4. paris, france, another one i added because of one thing, the eiffel tower!
            5. new orleans, louisuana, to be compleatly honest, im not sure why i added new orleans... oh well!
